# Shipwright Marketplace — Conversion Design

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Author:** Owais Mohamed
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. What We're Building

Convert the existing Shipwright repo (`RelationalAI/shipwright`) into **shipwright-marketplace** — RAI's curated Claude Code plugin marketplace. This sits alongside the existing community marketplace (`RelationalAI/claude-plugins`), serving as the official, quality-gated tier.

### Relationship to claude-plugins

| Marketplace | Purpose | Governance |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `claude-plugins` | Community/personal plugins from anyone at RAI | Open |
| `shipwright-marketplace` | Curated, supported plugins | CODEOWNERS-gated |

Both coexist. Neither replaces the other.


---

## 2. Marketplace Architecture

### Approach: Hybrid Monorepo

All plugins live in a `plugins/` directory within this repo. The marketplace also supports external GitHub-sourced plugins for future additions.

```
shipwright-marketplace/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES
├── templates/
│   ├── SKILL_TEMPLATE.md
│   └── AGENT_TEMPLATE.md
└── plugins/
    ├── dockyard/
    └── shipwright/
```

### Why hybrid?

- Local plugins (`./plugins/X`) are simple to manage in a monorepo
- External plugins (`github: owner/repo`) can be added later for third-party contributions
- This is the same pattern used by `claude-plugins` today

## 3. Plugins at Launch

Two plugins ship at launch. Shipwright depends on Dockyard.

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  shipwright-marketplace  │
│                     │
│  ┌───────────────┐  │
│  │   dockyard    │  │  ← standalone skills + commands
│  └───────────────┘  │
│         ▲           │
│         │ depends   │
│  ┌───────────────┐  │
│  │  shipwright   │  │  ← orchestration + internal agents
│  └───────────────┘  │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Dockyard — Standalone Skills & Commands

Everything that works independently, without orchestration.

**Skills:**
- `brownfield-analysis` — 7-doc codebase profiling
- `observability` — Query logs, spans, metrics for incident investigation

**Commands:**
- `/debug` — Standalone systematic debugging (4-phase root cause)
- `/codebase-analyze` — Generate codebase profile docs
- `/doc-digest` — Interactive section-by-section document review
- `/investigate` — Observability-driven live service investigation

**Agents:**
- `doc-digest` — Document walkthrough agent

### Shipwright — Orchestrated Workflows

Everything that requires the multi-agent orchestration pipeline.

**Commands:**
- `/shipwright` — Main orchestrator (Triage → Implement → Review → Validate)
- `/report` — File bugs/feedback on this repo
- `/promote` — Beta → stable promotion

**Internal agents** (not user-facing):
- `triage` — Understand bug and codebase
- `implementer` — Root cause, TDD, fix, verify
- `reviewer` — 2-pass code review
- `validator` — Regression and fix verification

**Internal skills** (used by agents, not directly by users):
- `tdd`
- `systematic-debugging`
- `verification-before-completion`
- `anti-rationalization`
- `decision-categorization`

## 5. Marketplace Registry

### marketplace.json

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://anthropic.com/claude-code/marketplace.schema.json",
  "name": "shipwright-marketplace",
  "description": "RAI's curated Claude Code plugin marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Owais Mohamed",
    "email": "owais.mohamed@relational.ai"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "dockyard",
      "description": "Standalone skills and commands for engineering workflows — brownfield analysis, observability, debugging, codebase profiling",
      "source": "./plugins/dockyard"
    },
    {
      "name": "shipwright",
      "description": "Orchestrated agentic development framework — TDD-enforced bug fix workflows with triage, implementation, review, and validation agents",
      "source": "./plugins/shipwright"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding external plugins later

Future third-party plugins use GitHub sources:

```json
{
  "name": "raicode",
  "description": "Julia development tools for the RAI engine",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "RelationalAI/raicode-plugin",
    "ref": "main"
  }
}
```

## 7. Dependency Enforcement

Shipwright requires Dockyard. This is enforced at session startup via a hook.

### How it works

Shipwright ships a `SessionStart` hook that reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` and checks for Dockyard. If missing, the hook exits with code 2, which hard-blocks the session.

### hooks/hooks.json

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/check-dockyard.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### hooks/check-dockyard.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
REGISTRY="$HOME/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json"

if [ ! -f "$REGISTRY" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Shipwright requires the 'dockyard' plugin."
  echo "Install it with: /plugin install dockyard@shipwright-marketplace"
  exit 2
fi

if ! jq -e '.plugins | keys[] | select(startswith("dockyard@"))' "$REGISTRY" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: Shipwright requires the 'dockyard' plugin."
  echo "Install it with: /plugin install dockyard@shipwright-marketplace"
  exit 2
fi
```

### User experience

**Missing Dockyard:**
```
> claude
⚠ Plugin error (shipwright): Missing required dependency.
  The 'dockyard' plugin is required by shipwright but is not installed.
  Install it with: /plugin install dockyard@shipwright-marketplace
  Then restart your session.
```

**Dockyard already installed:**
```
> claude
✓ All plugins loaded.    ← hook passes silently
```


---

## 8. Installation

### For users

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/RelationalAI/shipwright

# Step 2: Install Dockyard (standalone skills — works on its own)
/plugin install dockyard@shipwright-marketplace

# Step 3 (optional): Install Shipwright (orchestration — requires Dockyard)
/plugin install shipwright@shipwright-marketplace

# Step 4: Restart Claude session
```

### For teams (auto-configure via repo settings)

Add to the project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": [
    "dockyard@shipwright-marketplace",
    "shipwright@shipwright-marketplace"
  ]
}
```


---

## 9. Governance

### Plugin curation

New plugins are added to `marketplace.json` only with CODEOWNERS approval. This controls what enters the curated marketplace.

### Skill and agent contributions

Anyone at RAI can submit skills or agents to existing plugins via PR.

**Quality gates (all three required):**

1. **Template compliance** — Must follow `templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` or `templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Smoke test** — Must include a basic test or demo showing the skill works
3. **PR review** — Approved by CODEOWNERS

### Where to contribute

| Contribution type | Target plugin |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Standalone skill (no orchestration needed) | `dockyard` |
| Standalone command (no orchestration needed) | `dockyard` |
| Orchestration-related agent or skill | `shipwright` |
| New plugin | Requires CODEOWNERS approval in `marketplace.json` |


---

## 10. Naming Alternatives Considered

The chosen naming is **marketplace = `shipwright-marketplace`, plugin = `shipwright`**. Other options were evaluated:

| Option | Install command | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------------|------|------|
| **`shipwright-marketplace` + `shipwright`** | `/plugin install shipwright@shipwright-marketplace` | Clear branding. Plugin keeps its name. Marketplace is obviously a marketplace. | Slightly verbose install command. |
| `shipwright` + `shipwright-core` | `/plugin install shipwright-core@shipwright` | Short marketplace name. | Plugin loses its name. `core` is generic. |
| `shipwright` + `shipwright` | `/plugin install shipwright@shipwright` | Shortest possible. | Awkward duplication. Confusing to users. |


---

## 11. Post-Launch Requirements

These are mandatory follow-ups, not optional improvements.

### 11.1 Separate repos for version pinning

**Problem:** Local plugins (`"source": "./plugins/X"`) always resolve to HEAD. There is no way to pin a local plugin to a specific version or tag.

**Solution:** Extract plugins into standalone repos. Reference them in marketplace.json as GitHub sources with `ref` and `sha` fields for pinnable versioning.

```json
{
  "name": "shipwright",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "RelationalAI/shipwright-plugin",
    "ref": "v1.0.0",
    "sha": "abc123..."
  }
}
```

### 11.2 Author/maintainer → team ownership

**Problem:** Plugin manifests currently list an individual author.

**Solution:** Move ownership to a group or team identifier. Specifics depend on how Claude Code evolves its author schema, or can be handled via CODEOWNERS at the repo level.


---

## 12. Technical Constraints

Discovered during research, recorded for reference.

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| No native plugin dependency field in Claude Code | Can't declaratively say "shipwright needs dockyard" | SessionStart hook with exit code 2 |
| Local plugins can't be version-pinned | Users always get HEAD | Post-launch: move to separate repos with GitHub source refs |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` doesn't work in markdown files | Can't use plugin-relative paths in skill/command content | Only use in hooks.json and MCP config files |
| Marketplace schema URL returns 404 | Schema reference is decorative | Known upstream bug (anthropics/claude-code#9686) |
| Plugin cache keyed on version string | Must bump version in plugin.json for users to receive updates | Document in CONTRIBUTING.md |
